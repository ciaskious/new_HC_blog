The day I have been fearing the most, has come... It is the day that my brain decided to go back to "learn a little bit of everything in one day" mode -.-

As it was a sprint planning day, I came in this morning with several questions:

* **Is it time to deep dive into Functional Programming?** meeeh... yes and no! I tried to follow Odersky's coursera course in the past, but I got very very soon very very bored.  
Instead, I got today 2 Udemy courses  for scala and FP. The first one is for beginners - perfect opportunity to recap all the things I learned from the book and practise more. To be honest, I really like books, but I love video courses! I have taken several so far, and except for Ordesky's, I had a great time.  

* **More Scala practice?** Yes! Daily commitment to Exercism has only benefits and learnings.

* **What about something new and hands-on?** Hell yeah! But more tba... ;)

* **More Bash?** Yes! I thought I had a good knowledge of it until I came to HC. After my first self-assessment, I discovered how much more there is to explore - jq, cut, tail, less, more, tr, xargs ( [grep and sed](https://ciatastrophe.netlify.com/post/day19-20/) are already covered in a blog post ;) ) . But what's interesting about this: I will learn it the hard way!

### Za hard way?

Well, I had the impression my way is hard enough already! I found out about [Zed Shaw](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-Zed-Shaw-the-author-of-Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way) and his hard way to learn programming and tools. It is all learning by doing with his books! Zed, you might be rude and aggressive, but the hard way, I have to agree, it is the most effective - always from a personal point of view. Actually, this has been my main issue all these years with books and especially with University's books --> way too much theoretical! No sweat... The first book I loved was "Kubernetes In Action", because it has the ideal (for me) theory - hands-on-examples ratio. Since then, I try to be careful with the books I choose and then always stop and practice.

> The biggest learnings, the ones you never forget, don't come when we know the rules but when we challenge ourselves and play with them ;)

Just get to know the basic concepts and in parallel struggle by implementing them in your IDE/terminal/piece of paper.
