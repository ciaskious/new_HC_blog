### How I ended up to tries today?

Well, I started my day motivated for week 3 on Coursera! During the lesson on class hierarchies, what actually got my attention were class extensions. My train of thought had to question and research many terms, so I will try to sum it all up here in this very short post.

### How-to-do-it vs Why-use-it

Although I have used class extensions before, sometimes is good to get back to things and pay attention to the detail. Although I didn't get something super new on the topic, somehow I feel like I am finally getting the point of "functional" and "immutability", and really understanding more on data structures; what opened my eyes was ``persistent data structures``, which were referred as the _cornerstone of scaling functional programming_ in the video. And what really made my day, was this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo0qiGPSV-s) on tries. But first things first...

### What are tries? Why do we care about immutability? How many times a day do pandas poop?

I want to avoid the "google-theoritical" stuff:  

* A trie ( pronounce like try) is a persistent, concurrent, tree-like data structure. It is used

* At a first glance, the trie looks like a hash table  
*

And last but not least... Pandas can poop up to 40 times a day **#factOfTheDay**

I tried a lot to verbalize it and here it is:
