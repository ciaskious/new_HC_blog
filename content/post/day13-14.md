### Test Driven Development

It has been already 3 weeks since I started this apprenticeship. I just check the previous blog post every time I write, I am not even counting. I would, if this was something that would end at some point, but learning is never gonna end. So, as yesterday I didn't post something - I got trapped into my TDD exercises. I started writing about it, then I realized how much more I need to practice and in the end I didn't wanna talk about it... #no_logic  
So, this is my apologetic Friday blog post - although it felt like a Monday :)  

Today, I did my first morning-kata with the other apprentices. I really enjoyed the process and everyone gets the chance to contribute to the task.

> You start with baby steps, just to fail the test. Write only enough code to pass the test. Then, refactor.

Of course, the example on my previous post was not good enough - I am still practicing and learning from my mistakes. But I find myself improving already and this motivates me to go on.

### Fun Driven Development

Today we tried Mob Programming. It was [Deirdre's initiative](https://dbringas.netlify.com/posts/2018-11-10-day29/) and I think it's gonna become a thing for the apprentice's team. We all gathered around one laptop and tried the [Mars Rover kata](http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata). Each one of us got the chance to be the driver at the laptop. The rest of were navigators, trying to correct and propose ideas for the code. As all first attempts, it didn't go as planned, but we still did it all together and learned from each other. We talked about the session in the end and will do a follow-up next week with some improvements:

* More time for the driver ( we started with 5' and will extend to 10')
* Short break in between to recap and recharge
* More engagement for navigators ( this actually brought the team, in my opinion, even closer today).

It was new, productive (even more in the next iterations) and fun!

### Learning Driven Development

My sprint is not over. I will keep the planning on Tuesdays, as I need 5 full days to finish my weekly tasks and reach my goal. I will come back on Monday caffeinated and (hopefully) not that much sleep deprived. Inheritance is next and maybe a cool idea for a hands-on project might come up during the weekend. As I have said, it is my only way for now to evaluate my progress. ;)  

Servus und schÃ¶nes Wochenende !
