### The Sprint

So, Monday... My first sprint began today and my goal is to reach the 4th Chapter of my scala book and setup my toolbox.
This means that during this week, another vim related post should come up.  [Deirdre](https://dbringas.netlify.com/) and I so far, will try Ensime with sbt and find out how useful it is for us as a tool. But first, I need to check vim for Scala. While researching on this, I found several exciting posts about Neovim and why to use it, e.g. "It fixes every issue I have with Vim...", but I haven't had any so far :S I will keep it in mind though, a lot can change till Friday.

#### Scala basics

So today I started with the **Scala for the impatient** by Cay S. Horstmann.

I focused on the first chapter today, as I really need to start again with the basics. I had written code in Scala a couple of times before, but I always needed help and guidance to finish my project. I was missing so many details, that I am already picking up with this book.   
What really annoyed me is, at some points I was bombarded with concepts that are going to be explained later... it interrupts my flow and it is quite disturbing. But it happened to me again with such "get-started-quickly" books and I guess in the future I will not even notice. It is the beginning and it is easy to get overwhelmed or discouraged.

Apart from that, there are sooooo many types and methods in Scala. So, what really helped today was to practice and get comfortable with the ScalaDocs, while doing some exercises on calling methods at the end of the chapter. To be honest, I rarely do such exercises but I enjoyed it. I run several times back to the theory, because I realised how easily I get distructed and miss paragraphs... ðŸ’© This is why I like implementing right away what I read, otherwise I cannot comprehend it.   

So the post was short, but many topics are already open for this week. :D
