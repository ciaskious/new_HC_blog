### Vim and Neovim

Last week I posted first time about vim. Today, after finishing the exercises of my Scala book on arrays, I felt the need for something different. So, I came back to Vim basics and I practised a little bit more on the commands. I wrote and edited two paragraphs without using my mouse at all! While exploring the vim plugins, I have to say I felt lost at first. I have used Vim for small edits but until today, especially for Scala, I am an IntelliJ person.  
So apart from my basic configurations on my .vimrc file, I decided to put some plugins with "vim-plug" to get started with Scala. This would be very helpful now that I am writing just short scripts. But I found so many posts about plugins on Neovim and I decided to give it a go right away...Mmmm well, forget about your .vimrc file. There is a way to share your configurations to Neovim, check ``` :help _nvim-from-vim ```
I am still trying to configure Neovim, although it is supposed to be simple, I am getting ``` Not an editor command: Blahblah ``` errors, so for now I continue with Vim. I feel I have to dedicate more time on this and it is a good chance to co-operate with my fellow apprentices that already use it and exchange tips ;)

I am convinced to try harder with vim and ensime, but I am looking for an interesting exercise to combine it all with SBT. I have used SBT a lot - I love it, and it would be a fun way to implement all the things I am learning so far.  
For me, it would be the best way to assess my progress so far. It is only the second week though, but I feel my learning curve is S-shaped. The curse of devs is to have frequent emotional roller coasters, but as an apprentice the point is to learn not to suffer in silence.   

> I never feel stuck on the "apprentices' island" !

There is always an answer or a different approach. It makes problems vanish and broadens your thinking.

It is a "short-post" day, but I intend to summarize and finish the "Maps and arrays" chapter tomorrow.  

Mal schauen... :D
