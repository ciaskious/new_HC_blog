Today I tried something I had in mind for a while: Learning in Pomodoros. It is a technique found in most articles and books about productivity at work, reducing distractions and efficient learning. I was afraid that this kind of strict splitting of my time in intervals would have a negative effect on my "multitasking" personality, but as I recently discovered that I was living a lie [more info](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx), I gave it try. I did 3 pomodoros in the morning( 25min is recommended but I did 20min) and I am amazed. It was challenging to go against my bad habit of mixing the things I want to focus on, but I was surprisingly rewarded with a better learning speed. I will definitely continue splitting my time more wisely this week.
