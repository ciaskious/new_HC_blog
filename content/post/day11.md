 It is. Carry on after reading this post :)

 **Fun fact**: My official Bday was 2 days ago. All my documents have the wrong date, because of a typo the clinic did :D  
 **Funnier fact than the one above**: I realized it when I was 14 and got my ID card.

 The critical age number is not here yet. I still have 5 more years to go through my bucket list before reaching a new decade. This last year  has been crazy.. I mean CRAZY! I moved to Germany just for 3 months, to challenge myself on learning new skills, experience innovation and work with startups. It was all new, but I felt this is where and how I want to work. I went on looking for an internship and I was lucky enough to continue as a Software Engineer at UnternehmerTUM. Scrum became my friend. I worked in agile teams and I tried to get the most out of our agile coaches. Programming is good, but the people are the reason I changed and improved.  

> Asking for feedback; being ready to accept it and improve in the next iteration. Actions! This is what really helped me go forward.

After my internship, I felt the need for a personal retrospective. All that time I was in a personal long sprint; I never took a breath to look back. It led to unpredictable ups and downs, but also emotional blockers. Although I could have used that time more wisely, that was the period I learned the most and got me to who I am right now as a person.
This post is not about reflecting on my life choices, this should take some more personal time. But I want to emphasize the influence this year had on my life and **how important this personal Scrum I am trying to implement during my apprenticeship is**.  

> Constant feedback, concrete & short-term goals, daily check-ins and use of all available resources.

These are my main principals and I am trying to implement them slowly into my routine in order to be more productive. It does not have to do only with my personal improvement; it is helpful for my teammates. Sharing learnings, asking/ giving feedback and not suffering in silence keep you engaged and motivated.

My sprint planning was done today, but my goal hasn't changed much since last week. I continue with my book on Scala, I am still too impatient to make a pause. I really want to attend the Katas sessions, but somehow I have been magically missing it. So this is definitely a task for me this week. ;)  
I didn't have time to do much on the Scala objects (because..Birthday), but tomorrow I will come back older and wiser to continue what I left behind me.
