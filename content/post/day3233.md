Not that I am an expert in ephemeral data structures, but along with [tries](https://ciatastrophe.netlify.com/2018/11/13/day30/) Î™ wanted to know more this. I decided to give a small lightning talk about it, in order to get questions and help myself understand it better.  
I only scratched the surface, I feel more confused than ever and most probably I will come back to this post in the future to correct myself. I would love this to happen, because it means I understood what's going on. Below I will share some of the main points. 

So, as choosing Scala for this apprenticeship journey, I came for the first time across many complex concepts and terms. I could not understand why most of the Scala collections are immutable, I just accepted it. But it all fits into the concept of functional programming, where destructive updates are not supported. This means I cannot just modify my Data Structure and destroy the previous version. All versions are expected to be preserved fully functional after any  successful operation. ``Persistent DS are effectively immutable, as the updates do not affect current version, but they yield to a new one. ``  

All immutable collections in Scala are persistent. What happens is called _structural sharing_ - we don't copy the whole structure, instead we share it by copying the path. For example, in a list:

The cost of immutability when you deal with big collections is sometimes an impact in performance, but in general you reduce complexity and unexpected changes or behaviors.  

So, although I didn't manage to deep dive into the topic, I still feel I learned a lot and gave a lightning talk to share it. It was my first ever, so of course it was weird and lame, but my challenge was not to give a public talk, but explain something that I am not good at. This means more of them will follow and who knows? Maybe the day comes that I will give a proper talk about something that I am really good at. Until then, I will keep struggling ðŸ˜…
