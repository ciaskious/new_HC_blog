### The overview

 Slow... sloth-slow... Feels like time stops sometimes while trying to understand what I am reading! But in reality, time's passing by and I am just slow.

The day was full of DÃ©jÃ  vus. One year ago, I started my first internship as a Software Engineer. During that time, I got my first small project in order to get started with Scala, which in the end was combined with Java code. I was familiar with the syntax but it took me ages to figure out how to do the stuff. I got most of the help from my mentor in the company, [Michael](https://twitter.com/stockerlm), who was trying so hard to make me think and come up with solutions. He was saying " oh, this... yeah, in Scala it is like that..." and I was shocked by all the details he was throwing in there.  
But today, I understood most of it. While reading the 2nd chapter of my book, all these confusing lines of code were comming back and they were making so much sense finally! ðŸ¤¯

### Steady as she goes

My personal challenge during this semester is to learn scala in-depth. This is something I rarely do. It's like my brain is always on "summary mode"; every time I read something, I get the concept fast but in the end I have missed all the valuable details.   
For example, I have read several things about Scala and functions but I discovered the truth about _Unit_ just today.

> The **_Unit_** type is the Java **_void_**. SAY WAT?  
We don't do chained assignments. WAT?
**_return_** works more like a **_break_** and you better not use it in functions...WAT?

And this is just the beginning. What I really enjoy: the exercises at the end of every chapter. They make me always always go back and pay attention to the details.   
Anyway, I am really poring over this book and I am really looking forward to working with the Scala arrays tomorrow.

```scala
def firstSprint( speed: String){if (speed=="slow") println("It's fine! Keep going ;D")}
```
