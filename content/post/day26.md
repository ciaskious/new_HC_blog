 Well, I just have to accept it! I get bored by focusing on one thing everyday! It is just the way my brain works; it has to be constantly stimulated. Gimmie a video course for the whole day... after 2 hours my bum will start getting itchy on the chair. Gimmie docker... I have spent so much time to understand it, that it is impossible to spend a day to go back to theory and write about it! Gimmie a book to recap bash and fill the gaps... and then go back to [day 25](https://ciatastrophe.netlify.com/post/day25/), because I have already complained about this :sweat smile:  

### fork and exec

These little guys made my day - I had to go back to the unix architecture and process management!
