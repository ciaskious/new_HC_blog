Well, this is clearly a blog...so here I am blogging :D

This is the first week of the apprenticeship, but to be honest, office already feels like home. I found my desk full of presents for my new start: a towel with the HolidayCheck logo ( I am gonna travel EVERYWHERE with it, I promise!), my precious book "The Software Craftsman" (aka Crafter, in my case), my laptop already set up <3 and other presents for my everyday life in the company. The most important --> A huge smile on everybody's face and a big loud welcome!

I have to admit that I don't remember even half of the names I heard but I never forget faces ;)
Anyway, the on-boarding was smooth; the environment is super "learning-friendly". At some points I felt exposed to more information that I could handle buuuuut it is all very very structured and I can get back to it anytime it's needed.

But the real challenge is this - the Blog. I always had the need to create a blog but even the thought of committing to it, is hard. As I am writing this post, the blog runs locally. For starters I am going safe with Hugo and I will continue "beautifying" it as days go by. I see it as a living thing, so it will be constantly changing and getting better along my journey...

I cramped both days in one post, so that I don't end up describing the whole on-boarding process.
More details and learnings will come up after setting up and deploying my blog :)
