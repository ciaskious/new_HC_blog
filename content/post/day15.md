### #Monday_thoughts #Current_sprint

As promised, I came back to the office caffeinated and sharp. During the weekend, instead of coming up with a new Scala project idea, I went back to my jupyter notebook and worked on my thesis. It is a topic that I would like to give a lightning talk about in the office - machine learning is a big trend, but I am not gonna elaborate on this post. It just takes so much time for the algorithms to give results, it was the perfect opportunity to finally go back to my "The Software Craftsman" book.  

It was a big chapter about the agile and craftsmanship manifesto. I have experienced agile and now I took the crafter's journey. For the past year, I was living among startups and got very customer centric; I was doing interviews; design thinking; observing usability tests. For the first time in my life, I had to care first about the why's and not the how's.  

> During this apprenticeship I can finally slowly connect the dots between "building the _right thing_" and "building the _thing right_"

And this is what a crafter is about in my head right now: building the right thing the right way. Do not just make it work, take time to design and write your software.  

The fresh start for this week came with the next sprint's planning. My sprint is ending tomorrow and I feel already motivated for the following one. It is time for implementation, sweat and learnings; I want to explore more and take a break from the Scala book.  
Until then, I am reading the inheritance chapter and tomorrow I will have finished the exercises as well. So, hopefully a more technical post will occur, with examples on what I have worked on.  

The office is so quite this week because of [InnoDays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/innodays?src=hash) and this gives me mixed feelings. I am sad that I couldn't attend and this silence sometimes is not ok - I love listening to music while working, but I very often take them off, come back to reality and take a break while listening to my colleagues cooperating, discussing and solving issues together.  
Today the empty kitchen was a weird place for a quick break... I might visit the big one tomorrow and look for some new faces to meet, if there are any left on the floor for this week. ðŸ˜…
